# Privachat

## Abstract

Users can chat with other users and all messages between them must be
"end-to-end" encrypted (that means the server has no way to read their message
on technical).

## Goal

1. All source code must be open.
2. No meaningful data on the server (when the hacker succeeds attack the server,
   the thing she gets is nothing).
3. Users only receive the message in their contact (avoid spam).
